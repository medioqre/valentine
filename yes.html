    <h1>you pressed yes!</h1>
    <div>You had to go through that boldy stuff to get here.. congrats for surviving</div>
    <div class="longText">First of all than you for finally accepting(even though it was forced (•ˋ _ ˊ•)) and i want to say thank you for the most amazing 169 days of my life. 
        Those are how many days it has passed since we met, august 28th right? i enjoyed every single moment with you even 
    if some of the days together were not as good as others, but we always fix them. I appreciate every moment with you even when
 my memory is like a goldfishies and i won't remember much, but i can say when we spend time together its the most fun time ever and i want to be like that forever. 
169 days into months is like.. 5.5 months. That's almost half a year! So far these are the best 5 months of my life and i cant wait to 
say "these are the best 10 years of my life" in 9.5 years and eventually "this life was the best cause of you". Thank you for being in my life and...<div class="heart">I LOVE YOU SO MUCH!!!</div> AND INFINITE KISSSESSSSSS <p>MWAH MWAH MWAHHHHHH</p></div>
